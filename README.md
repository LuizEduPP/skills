# AI Skills Collection

A curated collection of portable AI skills - templates, guides, and automations that work with any AI assistant.

## What Are Skills

Skills are reusable knowledge modules that enhance AI-assisted development. Each skill contains:
- Specialized documentation (SKILL.md)
- Automation scripts and tools
- Templates and references
- Standardized workflows

### Where Skills Work

Skills are **portable knowledge modules** that work wherever you use them:

- ✅ Any AI assistant that can read markdown files
- ✅ Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Claude Web
- ✅ Copilot Chat, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI
- ✅ Even manual reference - just read the SKILL.md files

The `SKILL.md` format is plain markdown with frontmatter - usable anywhere.
